# Session Logger

Logs all sessions and their activities for memory persistence and debugging.

## How It Works

- Automatically logs when sessions start/end
- Captures session messages and activities  
- Maintains session history in memory/YYYY-MM-DD/session_logs.md
- Supports filtering and searching capabilities

## Usage

The logger should automatically activate when sessions begin. No manual intervention needed.
